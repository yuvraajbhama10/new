    <h2>What does it mean</h2>

    <p style="font-size:large">Wu wei means – in Chinese – non-doing or <em>‘doing nothing’</em>.
    It sounds like a pleasant invitation to relax or worse, fall into laziness or apathy.
    Yet this concept is key to the noblest kind of action according to the philosophy of <strong>Daoism</strong>– and is at the heart of what it means to follow Dao or The Way.</p>

    <h2>Daoism</h2>
    According to the central text of Daoism, the Dao De Jing: ‘The Way never acts yet nothing is left undone’. This is the paradox of wu wei. It doesn’t mean not acting, it means ‘effortless action’ or ‘actionless action’. It means being at peace while engaged in the most frenetic tasks so that one can carry these out with maximum skill and efficiency. 
    Something of the meaning of wu wei is captured when we talk of being ‘in the zone’ – at one with what we are doing, in a state of profound concentration and flow.

    <blockquote>The Dao De Jing points out that we should be like water, which is ‘submissive and weak’ and ‘yet which can’t be surpassed for attacking what is hard and strong’.</blockquote>
